Once upon a time there was a boy named Finn who loved to play the piano. He practiced day and night, slowly becoming an excellent pianist. One day Finn had an important recital where all his friends were in attendnce. His hands were sweaty and knees were shaking; he had never performed in front of this many people!

Paragraph 2 (Jacob Hawig): 
He looked across the stage out into the front row and saw the familiar faces of his family and friends, this gentle comfort smoothed his nerves.
He drew a deep breath and then began to play. His fingers slow and steady at first soon began to leap across the keys. As hit fingers jumped and the music roared his hands stopped sweating and his knees stopped shaking. His music has his supreme attention, he had forgotten about the audience and all he could see and hear were the sheets of music in front of him. 
When his song finally came to a close Finn sat triumphant on the bench proud of the work he had just done, he beamed as he heard the crowd applaud.
Next up was Finn's twin sister....
